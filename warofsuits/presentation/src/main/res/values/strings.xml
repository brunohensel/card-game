Each player has a pile of cards to play, and a discard pile. \n\n 2 - The set must be shuffled at the beginning of each game.\n\n 3 - The whole set must be split into two piles of equal size, each one must be given to each player. \n\n 4 - Players have access to (and can only play) the top card of their regular pile. \n\n5 - In each round, both players lay down a card. The one holding the highest value card wins the round, and puts both cards into their discard pile. \n\n6 - In case that both cards have equal value, the winner card is decided based on their suits (clubs, diamonds. hearts or spades). - The suit priority must be defined at random, at the start of each game. \n\n7 - Aces are high (values are, from lowest to highest: 2..10, J, Q, K, A). \n\n8 - The game finishes when both players have played all of their cards. \n\n9 - The user with more cards in their discard pile wins the game.</string>
